# To see the available files
lsblk

# allowed me to partition the giant sda file.

sudo fdisk /dev/sda  # fdisk: This is a command-line utility used for disk partitioning

Once inside fdisk, I used the following commands (press m for help):
•	n: Create a new partition.
•	p: Print partition table.
•	d: Delete a partition.
•	w: Write changes to disk and exit.
•	q: Quit without saving changes.

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda # command used to create new filesystem. 

# Verification command:

sudo blkid /dev/sdb1

# Creating directory:

sudo mkdir /mnt/newdisk

# Mount the formatted partition to the mount point

sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt/newdisk


# Filesystem is overlay type, which is not supported to export NFS filesystem. Home directory is also overlay type. At least in my case.
# /dev/sda is special device path. It represents the entire first SCSI (or SATA) disk drive in the system. 
Device files in /dev are used by the operating system to communicate with hardware devices.
