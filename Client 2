# Step 1: Ensure NFS Utilities Are Installed on Client 2, nfs-common installed to support NFS mounting. Ensure all the required configurations are set for 
client1 and original server.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-common

# Mount the Re-exported NFS Share from Client 1:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfscascade
sudo mount 192.168.42.106:/mnt/nfsshare /mnt/nfscascade

# Verify the mount

ls -l /mnt/nfscascade



Example Workflow to Verify Cascading NFS
On the Original NFS Server:

cd /mnt/newdisk
echo "File from NFS Server" > server_file.txt
ls -l

# On client 1:

cd /mnt/nfsshare
ls -l
cat server_file.txt
echo "File from Client 1" > client1_file.txt
ls -l

# On client 2

cd /mnt/nfscascade
ls -l
cat server_file.txt
cat client1_file.txt
echo "File from Client 2" > client2_file.txt
ls -l

# Verify Directory Permissions

sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/nfsshare
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/nfsshare

# The command /etc/exports will always be there if we transport NFS file system
